# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe

## 🤩😁 Inspiration
A big thanks ❤️ to the [React's](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe) official website for a clearly laid down **Learning by doing** Tic-Tac-Toe project. It was a great learning experience where I delved into the intricate details about React, or better, *thinking in React* 😀!

## 🧩 Features
### Scoreboard🧩
A scoreboard for each player is maintained for every game, which is updated when a game terminating event occurs(i.e. someone wins or Match is drawn).

### Game Controls 🕹 
- *Undo button:* To undo the game's current state.
- *Restart button:* To restart the game, keeping the scoreboard intact.
- *Reset:* To reset the game along with the scoreboard.

## 🛰🚀 Deployment
